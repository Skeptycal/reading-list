# Reading List for Chrome.

Kind of.

If you’re like me, you dislike Safari but love Safari’s Reading List. I use Chrome on my desktop and find all kinds of things I want to look at later, but I do most of my reading on my iOS device in mobile Safari. This is a small automation workflow that can take whatever page you’re looking at in Chrome, open Safari with that URL, add to Reading List, push a notification, and quit. It's silly, but it works. I’ve hooked it up to a global system keyboard shortcut (⌘ + Shift + E) so syncing pages to Reading List is easy.

### Installation

1. **Add the service**: [Download the workflow file](https://github.com/fabianperez/reading-list/releases/download/1.0.0/add-to-reading-list.zip) first, then follow [this guide (link)](https://www.macosxautomation.com/automator/serviceinstall/index.html) to install it.
1. **Register a shortcut**:
    1. Open System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts
    1. Click the Services category on the left, then scroll down on the right side to “Add to Reading List” to set your shortcut.
1. **Try it!**: Head to some cool article you found on Twitter or whatever and hit your shortcut. You should get an OS X notification to verify the workflow worked. Enjoy!
